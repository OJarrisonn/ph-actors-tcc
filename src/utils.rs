/// Installs custom panic and error hooks that restore the terminal state before printing errors.
///
/// This function replaces the standard color_eyre panic and error hooks with custom ones
/// that ensure the terminal is properly restored to its normal state before any error
/// messages are displayed. This is important for maintaining a clean terminal state
/// even when errors occur.
///
/// # Returns
/// `Ok(())` if the hooks were successfully installed.
///
/// # Errors
/// Currently, this function always returns `Ok(())` as it's a placeholder for future
/// implementation. In the future, it may return errors if the hooks cannot be installed.
///
/// # Examples
/// ```
/// install_panic_hook()?;
/// ```
pub fn install_panic_hook() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    Ok(())
